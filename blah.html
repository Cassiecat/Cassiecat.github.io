        - Unlike the other sports I played, I did not start basketball until I was a freshmen in highschool.<br>
        - I learned quickly that basketball is my least favorite sport to play.<br>
        - In college, I decided to replace basketball with ultimate frisbee which is way more fun.</div>

    <div style="display:block;text-align:left; font-size:20px"><img align="right" src="bball2.jpg"> Ultimate Frisbee<br>
        - Now I play both on an intramural team and the club for ultimate frisbee.<br>
        - Fun Fact: I had never touched a frisbee before I started playing ultimate frisbee in college</div>
